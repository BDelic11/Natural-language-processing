# 🧠 NLP Notebooks — Faculty Project (FESB)

This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks I created as part of my university course in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** at **FESB (Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Naval Architecture)**.

The notebooks include:

- ✍️ Explanations of NLP theory
- 🧪 Hands-on examples using Python
- 📚 Applications with `nltk`, `sentiwordnet`, `googletrans`, and others

These notebooks serve both as a **learning journal** and a **personal reference** for key NLP concepts I studied during the course.

Feel free to explore
